# AICP-TASKS-WEEK-6-
A program is needed to allow a Wildlife Park to sell tickets. A booking consists of one or more tickets for the same day(s) and can be made up to a week in advance. A booking can be made for a visit of one day or two consecutive days. A booking can have extra attractions included. A booking will be valid for the day(s) chosen only.

Write and test a program or programs for the Wildlife Park:
1. Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data. Data must be validated on entry.
2. All outputs, including error messages, need to be set out clearly and understandably.
3. All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.
4. You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.

**Task 1**
Displaying the ticket options and the extra attractions available Set up your program to:
1) display the options, attractions and prices for one-day tickets
2) display the options, attractions and prices for two-day tickets
3) show the days available for booking; assume that there are tickets available for any valid day. give a code in very easy way

**Task 2** – process a booking
Extend your program for Task 1 to:
input the tickets and extra attractions required, then calculate the total cost of the booking allocate a unique booking number display the booking details, including the total cost and the unique booking number repeat as required.

**Task 3** – ensuring each booking is the best value
Check that the total for each booking gives the best value and offer an alternative if this is not the case. For example, buying two family tickets is better than a group ticket for group of 10 that includes four adults and six children.
